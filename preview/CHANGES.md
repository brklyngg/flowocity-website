## Design Philosophy

### Subtle, Not Loud
- No aggressive redesign
- Maintains existing brand aesthetic
- Changes are in copy, not layout
- Professional confidence through specialized language

### Strategic Keyword Placement
Keywords that resonate with AI founders:
- **Q2T3 growth** (industry-standard volatile growth pattern)
- **Ex-compute gross margin** (AI-specific profitability metric)
- **FinOps** (cloud cost optimization discipline)
- **Consumption-based revenue** (usage-driven pricing model)
- **Volatile/spiky growth** (non-linear adoption curves)
- **Compute costs as COGS** (AI infrastructure economics)

---

## Technical Implementation

### Files Created
1. `/preview/index.html` - Complete preview homepage
2. `/preview/preview-styles.css` - Custom styles for new sections
3. `/preview/CHANGES.md` - This documentation

### Asset References
- All assets reference parent directory: `../assets/`, `../styles.css`, `../script.js`
- Fully functional standalone page
- No links from main site to preview (isolated)

## How to Share with Partners

1. **Preview URL:** `https://www.flowocity.ai/preview/`
2. **Not indexed:** Search engines won't find it (noindex meta tag)
3. **Standalone:** Not linked from main site navigation
4. **Commenting:** Partners can review and provide feedback on positioning

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

If this positioning resonates, consider:
1. Adding specific AI-SaaS case studies or testimonials
2. Creating a "Why AI-SaaS is Different" explainer section
3. Building out a Resources page with AI-SaaS finance content
4. Adding specific metrics examples/screenshots (if available)

## Summary of Value Proposition Shift

| Aspect | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| **Target** | High-growth tech startups | AI-SaaS startups specifically |
| **Expertise Signal** | Generic finance capabilities | Specialized AI-SaaS metrics (Q2T3, ex-compute GM, FinOps) |
| **Pain Points Addressed** | Standard startup finance needs | Volatile growth, compute costs, consumption revenue |
| **Credibility Proof** | Professional experience | Deep understanding of AI business models |

## Key Metrics Section Breakdown

The new "Metrics for the AI Era" section acts as a qualification checklist. An AI founder reading this thinks:

✅ "They understand my revenue is split between ARR and usage"
✅ "They know what Q2T3 growth means"
✅ "They can calculate my true software margin excluding compute"
✅ "They track AI-assisted sales efficiency"
✅ "They understand FinOps and cloud cost allocation"

**Result:** Instant credibility and relevance.
